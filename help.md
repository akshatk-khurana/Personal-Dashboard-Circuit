# Personal Dashboard
This dashboard is meant to serve as a small accessory on desks to do simple things like playing music and running a timer/stopwatch.

I've done the wiring colours to make it easy to know what wire is for what;
- Orange wires are for GND pins
- Blue wires are for GPIO pins
- Red wires are for VCC/3V3 pins
